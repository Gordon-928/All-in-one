STM32 CUBEIDE
CLOCK SETTING
- Set required clock source and run clock solver

SPI SETTING
- Change prescaler to change the baud rate (this step is mainly to tune to the required baud rate)

TIMER SETTING - PWM
- Change prescaler to change PWM freq
- This depends on the clock that the timer is on, refer to datasheet
- Look for the clock frequecny and change the prescaler to achieve desired frequency
	- e.g: want to scale down the timer clock from 84 MHz (APB1) to 10 Hz
	       i) Prescaler set to => 8400-1 (84e6 / 8400 = 10k) //set the freq of the counter is changed
              ii) counter period set to 100-1 (10k/100 = 100Hz) //counter need to count to 100-1
              Note: 
 	      - the -1 offset is needed (counter start from 0, if we want a 16 bit timer to count 2^16 times, it just need to count from 0-2^16-1)
              - must check if counter exceed the size of the regiester xxbit timer (e.g. 16 bit timer has a max value of 2^16 = 65536)
