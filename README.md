# All-in-one
Design and program of a small package data collection device
This project aims to learn the bascis of using STM32 MCU and PCB layout with MCU and sensors. The ultimate goal of the project is to develope a all-in-one sensor to collect flight data of a rocket, drop tests and other possible usage. Personal goal is to make a sensor close to commercial grade with all well-though start-up sequence, easy to use and robust software.
